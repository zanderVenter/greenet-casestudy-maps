### Grassland productivity:
We used Sentinel-2 imagery to create a relative yield index for each case study area. The code to run this in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor (JavaScript API) is named "relative_yield_index.js"

### Grassland mowing/grazing:
We used the methods and code described here to generate maps of mowing/grazing frequency and date for case study areas: https://github.com/davidfrantz/force-udf/tree/main/python/ts/mowingDetection
